# Beginner

# Introduction

This section contains details on set of things a beginner JavaScript developer is expected to know theoretically and practically.

### Programming Language

- **Refs:**

Get introduced to programming concepts.

- Meaning of programming language
- High-Level vs Low-level programming languages
- Types in Programming Languages
- Strong vs Weak Types
- Static vs Dynamic Types
- Interpreting vs Compiling Languages

### The JavaScript Language

- **Refs:**

Understand what is JavaScript and what is it for. Understand which of the following categories does JavaScript fit in:

- static or dynamic programming language
- strong or weak type programming language
- interpreting or compiling programming language

### JavaScript vs ECMAScript

Be able to differentiate JavaScript from ECMAScript.

# Variables and Data Types

### Variable

You should know what is a variable, how to declare a variable, how to reference it in other part of the program and how it affects computer memory.

### Data Type

There are several data types in JavaScript, knowing them and knowing when to use them is very important.

### Primitive Data Types

You should be able to differentiate between primitive data types and other data types.

- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Number
- String
- Symbol

### Collective Data Types

There are several collective/reference data types in JavaScript. **Array** and **Object** are the most common ones, but there are others like **Set** and **Map**. If you are new in JavaScript, you can just learn how to use arrays and objects, then the rest be can be learned later.

- Array
- Objects
- Set
- Map

### Reference vs Primitive values

- **Ref:**

Understand how reference and primitive value works.

# Expression vs Statement

- **Refs:**

    [https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/expressions](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/expressions)

One of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript is to be able to differentiate between an expression and a statement. Knowing the deference gives you confidence when explaining things to your co-workers or during an interview. It says a lot about how you understand the language.

# Operators

- **Refs:**

    [https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/javascript-operators](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/javascript-operators)

Understanding all types of JavaScript operators and usage contexts.

- Arithmetical Operators
- Logical Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Conditional Operators

# Program Flow

Understanding how programming flow works in JavaScript. Learn to use conditions and Iterations to build logic.

- Condition in JavaScript
- Iterations in JavaScript

# Function

It is important to understand how functions are created in JavaScript, how parameters are passed and how they are executed or invoked.

# Scope, Context, and Hoisting

- **Refs:**

    [https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-scope/](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-scope/)

Depending on how and where a variable has been declared, to access a declared variable in other part of the code always depending on the context it declared.

- Scope
- Context
- Hoisting

### Meaning of Scope

Understand what scope means in JavaScript world.

### Types of scopes

You need to understand different types of JavaScript scopes.

- Global scope
- Block scope
- Module scope
- Functional scope
- Lexical scope

### Variable declaration keywords

- **Ref:**

Understand different implications of declaring variables with the following keywords. The implication of both primitive and collection data types.

- var
- const
- let

- **Examples:**

    ```jsx
    var variable1;
    const variable2 = "assigned value";
    let variable3;
    ```

### Usage of "typeof" operator

- **Refs:**
    - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)

You should be familiar with "typeof" and how to use it.
